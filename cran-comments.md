## New Submission - RDota2 Package

## Test environments
* local windows, R 3.3.0, R devel (also winbuilder on CRAN)
* ubuntu 12.04 LTS (on travis-ci), R 3.3.1

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Additional

I can see when building on winbuilder on CRAN:

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  API (3:19, 13:27)
  Dota (3:42, 13:50, 14:31)

None of them is actually mis-spelled as the package is an API client and Dota is the name of the game for which I built a package.
